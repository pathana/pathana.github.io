I had another very successful and quick advising session with Jen today. We discussed my approach to utilizing the Google Maps API and the new curve my project will be going towards. The end goal is still the same, just a different approach on what I'd like to show for my prototype than I had initally planned, in a good way! 

Over the past week, I have been diving deeper into seeing how the Google Maps API works and what it would entail with everything that I want to have it do. I also researched more on doing the database part of the project. Upon speaking with Jen today, I think I might take the approach of using Laravel for my project. I am still not 100% sure on that though, but I'm leaning more towards that since Laravel is used quite a bit at my work. So it would be good to get some experience in that as well, since I haven't used it before yet.

For next week, I plan on getting the Maps API at least started and up and running in its early stages.
