Hello! So last week was technically spring break for us, so I didn't get to do as much as I had wanted, *but* I did get to work on some things, like searching up tutorials on how to get started with Laravel. 

I'm very grateful for the peer review discussion thread that we have though, because luckily I had 2 people answer to my post with things on Laravel, so that definitely helped a lot. I questioned whether to set up Laravel on my local machine first or just work on it on the live server, and it looks like there are a lot of tutorials on setting it up on your local machine first, and I've also heard that that was the best way. So I might as well just do that first then, and bringing it over to the live server shouldn't take up too much time but we'll see.

I was originally planning on just doing everything on the live server.... maybe I still can.
