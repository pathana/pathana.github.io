Update post 6! So I was able to meet with Ed on Tuesday, and it went very well! He gave me some great tips and pointers about where I'm at with my project so far. 

I have a bunch of JSFiddles with my different Google Maps API features codes. I've been playing around with these to make sure they work properly first, then combine them into one map and troubleshoot it to make sure everything still works properly. All of these features are needed for what my web app needs to be able to do. 

The layout of my one page website is still coming along. I hope to have that done very soon.
