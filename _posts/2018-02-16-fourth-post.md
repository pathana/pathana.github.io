As promised from last week, I'd get the Google Maps API in its early stages, which it is! I've been cranking away on that, and that's really all I've been focusing on right now. 

When Jen and I talked last week, she told me that a reasonable time to expect the API to be ready would be the end of the month, and I agreed with that. That seemed about right, given all the parts that I'd have to put together and then troubleshoot everything to make sure everything is functioning as it should. So I will continue working on that over the next few weeks.
