So this might be a little on the last minute side, but I decided that I was running to some trouble getting Laravel set up (I *did* get it set up where the main Laravel home page shows up correctly, but all the other internal files in the folders that come with the installation all show Fatal Errors on the pages for some reason). I also figured that this would have been a new area for me to learn because I've never used Laravel before, so it would've have been an even greater challenge for me. So ultimately, I went back to using PHP/MySQL for my backend. I'm more familiar with that and have done some work using PHP/MySQL. So it should be better for me, since using the Google Maps API is already challenging for me.

I have all my user research done! I went to 5 bars in the Seaport District of Boston, and 5 bars in Cambridge. One bar that was on the list was not open that day, so I decided to just go to the bar that wasn't on the list, but it was right next door, so it was more convenient and definitely worked anyway. Now I just have to put all the music information together, between my own data and user data from online reviews. I will be working on more of having the Google Maps API finalized and get more work done in the backend.
