Hello! So not *too* much of an update this week, just continuing with working on the Google Maps API from last week, familiarizing myself more with what features Google Maps has to offer for the API, which is a lot!

I wasn't able to schedule an appointment with Ed this week unfortunately, so that will have to wait till next week. But that should be fine! I feel like next week I'll have more things done anyway. 

I also want to focus more on getting the website layout up as well.
