Over the past week, I finished setting up the server and database environment for the project. I had started a spreadsheet about the music research from Yelp reviews, that is almost complete.

However, I had my first advising with Jen today and we had went over the project as a whole. It was good to hear her advice and what she thought about the project overall, which means after this meeting, this project took a little bit of a turn, for the better!

I am going to be incorporating more of a database use with PHP and MySQL and having users be able to create an account on the app. Also, I had originally planned to include 30 bars into the app, but I will be focusing less on the number of bars there are (there will only be about 5-10 now) and more on how user accounts work and more of the functionality of the database, which, in her opinion will be more exciting to see, and I agree with that! So I look forward to this curve in the project, and will also be looking deeper into Google Maps API and what it can do. This past week, I've only briefly gotten to look over all of its features.
