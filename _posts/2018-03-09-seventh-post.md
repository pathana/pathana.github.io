I had a great, quick advising session with Jen at the beginning of the week. Since I just had my advising session last week, I didn't have much to update her on except to just show her what I've done so far. 

I currently have the one page website that the app will be on, at about 85% done. I also have a good sample of my Google Maps API set up with a side panel. I just need to configure the bars that will show up on there and also set up Laravel to use. Currently I have the lat/long info for all the bar locations in a MySQL database. That should hopefully be useful for later though.

From here on, just going to keep pushing through!
