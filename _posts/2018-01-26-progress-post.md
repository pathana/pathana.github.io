Over the break, from November to today, I've been following my tentative schedule as best as I could. What I have done so far is:

* Research best layouts to display the web app
* Site map
* Low-fidelity wireframe
* High-fidelity wireframe
* Mockup

My next milestone is to have the server environment set up. This was supposed to be finished for Jan 10th, but I have not yet completed it and am still working on it. I do plan on having that finished in the next few days.

Other than that, I am still planning on staying on schedule for everything else. Another milestone that is coming up is to finish conducting the bar music research. Due to personal reasons, I have not gotten to start that yet, but definitely still plan on having that done for Feb 2nd, or at least around there.

For the next four weeks, I plan on:

* Having the server set up
* Web app layout built (or at least about 90% of it)
* Have Google Maps API set up
* Download all music for web app and have them uploaded on the server

Below are what I have completed:
