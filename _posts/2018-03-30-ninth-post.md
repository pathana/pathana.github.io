Hi everyone! I have my Google Maps API set up with the styling all done, custom map markers in place, and great functioning animation where when you click on a map pin, it will zoom in on that bar location, so that's fantastic!

I have a JSFiddle set up where the user types in their destination from Point A to Point B, and then they can also change their directions between transit, walking, or driving. Now I just have to change Point B to be a set location depending on which bar the user chooses. But the input fields autocomplete as you start typing, which is awesome.

I plan on continuing to work on this and get the stuff in JSFiddle incorporated into my map. I'd like to also get at least some of the Spotify playlists up and running for some of the bars.

I'm also currently setting up Laravel on the live server, so I hope to be done by next week.
