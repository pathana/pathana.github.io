Hey guys! Welcome to my Capstone blog! Here you will be learning and keeping up-to-date with everything that's happening with the Boston Bar's Music Taste web app. I figured with my first post, I'll add in my site map to kind of start things off. It's very straight forward, since there aren't many pages at all, but it's always good to see the site laid out visually.
